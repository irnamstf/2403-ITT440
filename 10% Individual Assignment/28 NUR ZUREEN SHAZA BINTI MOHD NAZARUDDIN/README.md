# VMware Installation 

## What is VMware Workstation Player ? 

VMware Workstation Player is a free desktop virtualization software application provided by VMware. It allows users to create and run virtual machines (VMs) on a Windows or Linux host operating system. It's designed for both personal and professional use, providing an isolated environment for running multiple operating systems on a single physical machine.

## Benefits of Using VMware Workstation Player : 

- VMware allows multiple virtual servers to run on a single physical server, maximizing resource utilization and reducing hardware costs.
- Developers can create isolated VMs to test new software, updates, or patches without affecting the production environment
-  Simplifies the backup process and improves disaster recovery capabilities by allowing entire VMs to be backed up and restored quickly.
-  VMs are isolated from each other, enhancing security by preventing issues in one VM from affecting others.
-  Easily take snapshots of VMs to capture their state and revert to previous states if something goes wrong during testing.
  

## What are the System Requirements for VMware on Windows 10 or 11 ?

    -A 64-bit processor is recommended. Ideally, it has four or more powerful cores.

    -16 GB of RAM is enough. But we recommend 32 GB or more for superior performance.

    -4 GB of disk space is primary. A recommended SSD enhances performance.

    -Windows 10 or 11 OS provides versatile functionality.

    -A valid license for VMware Workstation is essential. Ensure it’s the latest version 
    for the largest utility.
