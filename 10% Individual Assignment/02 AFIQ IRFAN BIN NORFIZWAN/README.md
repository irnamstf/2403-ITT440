# SIGHUP
## INTRODUCTION TO SIGNAL
- A signal is a **software generated interrupt** that is sent to a process by the OS because of when user press ctrl-c or another process tell something to this process.
There are fix set of signals that can be sent to a process. Signal are identified by integers. 
- It is asynchronously sent to a running program to notify it of some event. The system interrupts the process normal execution to trigger a specific reaction like, among other things, terminating it. Hence, signals are a sort of **inter-process communication**.

## HANDLING SIGHUP IN C
- The SIGHUP (“hang-up”) signal is used to **report that the user’s terminal is disconnected**.
- This signal is also used to report the termination of the controlling process on a terminal to jobs associated with that session, where the termination effectively disconnects all processes in the session from the controlling terminal.
- SIGHUP is commonly used to instruct deamon processes to reload the configuration files **without restarting it**. 
- The signal can be sent manually using function such as `kill()` or `raise()`. The standard library provides functions such as `signal()` to register signal handlers. This function defines the action need to be taken when the signal is received.

## SAMPLE CODING
````C
#include <signal.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>

void sighup();

void main(){
    int pid;
    pid = fork();

    if (pid < 0){
        perror ("fork");
        exit (1);
    }

    if (pid = 0){
        signal (SIGHUP, sighup);
        for (int x = 1;; x++);
    }

    else {
        printf("\nPARENT: sending SIGHUP\n\n");
        kill(pid, SIGHUP);
        sleep(1);    //pause for 1 second
    }
}

void sighup(){
    signal (SIGHUP, sighup);
    printf ("hangup\n");
}
